        <h2>Blueberry Pie Ingredients</h2>
        <p>These are the ingredients you'll need to make this top-rated blueberry pie <br />
            recipe:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Sugar</strong>: This blueberry pie recipe starts with a cup of white sugar.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cornstarch</strong>: Cornstarch thickens the blueberry pie filling, preventing <br />
                runniness.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cinnamon</strong>: ground cinnamoon adds subtle warmth.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Salt</strong>: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor of the blueberry pie filling, <br />
                but it won't make it taste salty.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Blueberries</strong>: Of course, you'll need fresh blueberries! If you can't find fresh,<br />
                 frozen (and thawed) will work.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Pie crust</strong>: Use a store-bought or <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/24094/butter-flaky-pie-crust/">homemade pastry crust</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Butter</strong>: You'll need just a tablespoon of butter.
            </li>
