   <p>
    The main point of this Italian meatball-inspired meatloaf is to show you what <r/>
    happens when you make meatloaf like your grandparents did. Duronig the <br/>
    Great Depression, this type of dish was a popular strategy for stretching what<br/>
    little meat you had into as filling a meal as possible.

    <li>&frac12; cup chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley</li>
    <li>2 ounces grated Parmesan cheese</li>

   </ul>
   <h2>Directions</h2>
   <h3>Step 1</h3>
   <p>
    Prehear oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch<br/>
    baking dish.
   </p>
   <h3>Step 2</h3>
   <p>
    Heat olive oil and butter together in a large skillet over medium-high <br/>
    heat. Saute onion with a pinch of salt in hot oil and butter until onion is <br/>
    golden brown and soft, 5 to 10 minutes. Add garlic and saute until fragrant, about <br />
    30 seconds. Remove skillet from heat and cool onion mixture to room temperature.
   </p>

   <h3>Step 3</h3>
   <p>
    Place bread crumbs in a large bowl. Add milk and stir with a fork until combined.<br />
    Let sit until all of the milk is absorbed into the breadcrumbs, 15 to 20 minutes.
   </p>

   <h3>Step 4</h3>
    <p>
        Combine ground chuck, cooled onion mixture, parsley, Parmesan cheese,eggs, 2 teaspoons<br />
        salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in bowl. Grab a handful of breadcrumbs and <br />
        squeeze very gently to remove excess milk. Repeat with remaining breadcrumbs, transfer<br />
        breadcrumbs to ground chuck mixture, and discard excess milk. Stir ground chuck mixture until <br />
        evenly comined.
    </p>
    <h3>Step 5 </h3>
    <p>
        Turn chuck mixture out into prepared baking dish, and shape meat into a 3x4x10-inch meatloaf.<br/ >
        Pour tomato sauce over the loaf and into the bottom of the dish.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 6</h3>
    <p>
        Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour 10 minutes <br />
        An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).<br />
        Let meatloaf rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing.
